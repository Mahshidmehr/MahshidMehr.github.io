<p align="justify">
I am a security engineering researcher passionate about hands-on system security and solving real-world security challenges. With a background in Software Engineering, I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Warwick, where I focused on the security of contactless payment systems.  With over five years of experience in system security, threat modeling, and secure architecture design, I have worked on securing a wide range of technologies, including payment systems, IoT, Edge-AI, and connected autonomous vehicles. Currently, I am a Cyber Systems Engineering Research Fellow at Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) within the Secure Cyber Systems Research (SCSR) group.
