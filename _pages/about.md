<p align="justify">
  I'm a Research Fellow at WMG, University of Warwick in the Secure Cyber Systems Research (SCSR) group. I got my PhD in Computer Science from the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick focusing on the security of payment systems, particularly contactless payment. Additionally, I hold an MSc in Software Engineering (IoT Systems) from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, and a BSc in Software Engineering from Semnan University, Iran.
  My passion lies in hands-on system security, tackling real-world challenges. My research interest is payment system security and IoT systems security, including smart home energy management, autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) security.
